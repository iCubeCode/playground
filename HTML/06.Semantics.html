        <h3>Chandrayaan-3</h3>
        <p>Chandrayaan-3 (transl. Moon-craft, pronounced /ˌtʃʌndrəˈjɑːn/ (listen)) is the third Indian lunar
            exploration mission under the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Chandrayaan programme.[6] It
            consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2
            mission. The propulsion module carried the lander and rover configuration to lunar orbit in preparation
            for a powered descent by the lander.[7][8]</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) launch vehicle
            consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover.[15] The lander was scheduled to touch down on the lunar
            surface on 6 September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover. The lander ultimately crashed when it lost
            contact with earth (ISRO) and deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land</p>
