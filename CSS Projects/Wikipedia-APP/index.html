            <p>Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
                Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books,
                television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.</p>
            <p>Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high
                school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents
                Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash, Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles
                of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J.
                Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and
                enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his
                superhuman spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include
                superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance, clinging to
                surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
                "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his
                own design, which he uses both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker
                originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that
                Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.</p>
            <p>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually
                relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by
                featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity,
                whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers
                could relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky
                Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the
                lesson for himself that "with great power comes great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in
                the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the late
                Uncle Ben Parker.</p>
            <p>Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is
                The Amazing Spider-Man. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a
                high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a
                member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also
                took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter
                appears to die.[9] Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man,
                including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future;
                Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate universe;
                and Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of
                Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right
                and was brought into mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he sometimes works
                alongside the mainline version of Peter.</p>
