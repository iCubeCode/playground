                <p>This sunny and spacious room is for those traveling light and looking for a comfy and cosy place to
                    lay
                    their head for a night or two. This beach house sits in a vibrant neighborhood littered with cafes,
                    pubs, restaurants and supermarkets and is close to all the major attractions such as Edinburgh
                    Castle
                    and Arthur's Seat.</p>
